### About  

This project provides users with a seamless online shopping experience. Users can visit the website, register, and log in to their accounts. They can browse all available products, filter and search items based on different categories, and add them to the cart. The cart allows users to add multiple items and adjust quantities as needed. Once the cart is updated, users can proceed to checkout and enter credit card payment details to complete the purchase. Upon successful payment, the order is placed, and users can view their order details and track the shipping status in the orders section.  

The admin plays a crucial role in managing the store. They are responsible for adding new products, updating existing items, removing products from the store, and managing inventory. Additionally, the admin can view all orders placed and update their status to "shipped" or "delivered" as per the order's progress.  

One of the key features of this project is email notifications. When a user registers, they receive a confirmation email. Similarly, users are notified via email whenever they place an order or when their order is shipped. If a product is out of stock, users attempting to purchase it will receive an email notification once it becomes available again.  

**Note:** The payment page is for demo purposes only and is not fully integrated with a payment gateway. Any credit card details will be accepted for demonstration, and demo orders will be placed accordingly.
